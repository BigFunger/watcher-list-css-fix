# watcher-list-css-fix

> Plugin to allow users to resize the watch list columns

---

## Summary

Injects a `less` file and some stub styles to address the column size issue on the Watch List page. To make changes to these styles, edit the [public/watcher-list-fix.less](https://github.com/BigFunger/watcher-list-css-fix/blob/master/public/watcher-list-fix.less) file in the plugin. 

Once the styles are how you like them, build the plugin using `npm run build` and then install the plugin into Kibana.
